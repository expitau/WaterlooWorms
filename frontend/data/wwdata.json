These virtual laboratories are built using Twinery, an HTML-based story building tool. The molecular animations are generated using Gaussian. Dr. Champagne, our collaborator at New Jersey Institute of Technology, has developed interactive animations of some relevant mechanisms to be incorporated into the virtual laboratories. \nThe applicant will be responsible mostly for the refinement of the code of the virtual laboratories. This includes refining the visual rendering of the 3D molecular animations, incorporation of said animations and energy profiles into the virtual labs. We are also interested in incorporating functionalities students have expressed interest in having in the virtual laboratories, such as a progress bar or menu to return to past portions of the laboratory.",

RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy. \nRideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation.

Our program helps establish a baseline of knowledge that gets you started building momentum. \nWhat is the program? \nThe program is eight workshops that are one hour long and delivered online and eight discussion sessions that are offered as hybrid sessions (online and in person) with office hours available that day. \nAt the end of the eight week program you will be included in a group chat that includes University of Waterloo Alumni that have built companies, some are also YC alumni, and a few are active investors. You will meet some of them during the eight week programming. They include Farhan Thawar (multiple startups, most recently acquired by Shopify), Hongwei Liu of MappedIn, David Villarreal of Parrot Software (YC Alumni), Shan Lian, Jay Shah (YC Alumni), Rami Ashamed of Push (sold to Whoop), and Andrew Cross of Goosechase. \nWhat are your criteria? \nThis part is simple, you are a Waterloo student and we, as Alumni, know you are awesome. The only other criteria is that you have the ability to work on something and make significant progress in a short amount of time. \nIs there future investment available? \nEigenspace intends to invest in your future rounds and is currently establishing a fund. We will actively help you raise your first round or help you apply to Y-Combinator or another accelerator. \nWe want to help you find your path to success. \nAm I an employee of Eigenspace? \nAs a Venture Founder you own your work.

Great restaurants, trendy coffee shops, beaches, hiking, golf, skiing, and even surfing are just some of the reasons you will love living here. \nStudent Testimonial \n\"Working at the Collingwood Foundry this summer has been an amazing experience. By working with Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs I have got to play many different roles in many drastically different industries. Doing everything from Quickbooks Data Entry to Social Media Management has allowed me to exercise the knowledge I have learned in school, and pick up new skills that will continue to help me in my career. I feel as though I have the experience of 4+ different internships under my belt after this term! \nI have also had the opportunity to use the Foundry as a networking and life experience tool. The Collingwood Foundry is an incubator of good people with good ideas, and I have been able to develop relationships with business professionals in a multitude of industries through meetings and social events. Every day here feels like a new lesson in how I could better myself, my work, and/or my community, and I love that my work term has allowed me to think critically about where I want to take my career from here.

To deterministically prepare configurations of atoms with a pre-defined two-dimensional spatial arrangement, we load a random configuration of atoms in an array of thousand of optical traps, image the atoms on a camera, identify the traps that are missing an atom, and displace the surplus atoms to their assigned location. Solving this reconfiguration problem requires exploiting (1) reconfiguration algorithms to determine which atoms to move to which locations in the most efficient way and (2) low-latency control systems to compute and execute the displacement trajectories within the lifetime of the atom configuration. \nWe are seek three students to help us design, build, benchmark, and optimize our low-latency control system. The low-latency control system exploits a multi-threaded programming of a CPU and GPU processors to execute the algorithms and interfaces multiple devices (camera, frame grabber card, arbitrary waveform generator) to interface with our experimental system, so a demonstrated experience and interest programming embedded systems in C/C++ will be valuable. \nThis project has been in development for more than a year now. Depend on our progress, the project description might be updated to expand the applicability of the system, e.g., to implement optimal control pulses or quantum error correction codes.",
  "responsibilities": "The students will be responsible for contributing to all aspects of the project to bring it to production level towards near-term deployment in our experimental system. The students will also be responsible for presenting their results during collaboration meetings with our international collaborators. We have already made significant progress in designing, building, and pre-benchmarking our algorithms and low-latency control system, so the first few weeks of the project will be dedicated to reviewing what has already been accomplished.",
  "skills": "We have more than three years of experience supervising the work of undergraduate students and getting them to advancing our research activities. Our students are getting admission to competitive graduate school programs and publishing their results generated while working with us. Our best students have so far came in with a stellar academic record and very strong academic background in system design, applied mathematics, and programming (acquired through both self-directed projects and formal courses), often without prior knowledge in quantum mechanics. They were independent, inquisitive, proactive, and hardworking, continuously seeking opportunities to improve themselves and achieve excellence. They enjoyed delivering elegant solutions to difficult problems. \nDesirable skills are strong programming skills for technical applications (e.g., C/C++, Python, Cuda, multi-threading/multi-processing systems), analytical and critical thinking skills (formulating hypotheses, gathering and synthesizing data, drawing conclusions), team working (working in small teams), and communication skills (presenting results in simple and clear logical terms). \nPlease highlight your skills and how you have acquired them in your cover letter.",

At Sibros, you'll have the opportunity to work at the forefront of disruptive technology running on millions of vehicles and used by leading EV and autonomous startups to some of the world's largest and most prestigious automakers. \nSibros offers competitive pay, but more importantly, interns acquire the experience working in the automotive domain. What is unique about Sibros is that you get to work with vehicle architectures from various companies and vehicles rather than a singular company as Sibros is essentially the technology supplier of the automotive industry. \nSibros and Waterloo have had a deep relationship. Several of our interns are returning Waterloo Interns who opt to come back to Sibros after having a very positive experience. Many of our interns also convert to full-time and come back to Sibros after graduation. . We can almost guarantee that your experience at Sibros for firmware or embedded systems development will be second to none, and this can be verified by talking to former Waterloo students who have interned with us. \nAt Sibros, we strive for automation. We want to ensure that all of our Firmware products are validated in the most automated ways possible, to eliminate the need for human intervention during the testing cycles. You will feel proud having the experience Sibros can provide.
